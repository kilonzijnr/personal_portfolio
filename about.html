                forward to becoming a world class <em>Computer Expert.</em><br>As i grew up i started developing a clear
                mind on
                what i really wanted to do in the Tech World.<br>So during my highschool period i decided I would do a
                coursse on Programming and later on do a course on <strong>Cyber Security & Forensics.</strong>
                <br>After finishing
                highschool I heard of Moringa School and thats when I decided I would do the Software Development
                Course.<br>Later on I want to enroll to university to do a course on <strong>Cyber Security.</strong>
